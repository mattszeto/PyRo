PROJECT DEPRECIATED -> Moved to another repo (coming soon)

## PyRo

Python trading Robot that can track historical stock data or real-time stock market data for algorithmic trading. It can store and keep track of trades made, including
current positions in any portfolio. Its basically the foundation for a trading robot, with indicator functions, as well as alert, buy, and sell functions.

Uses TD ameritrades API for collection historical/real-time stock data.

decided to open this to the open-source community because I haven't found time to add to it yet..

_This has been my Quarantine project and It's definitely far from done._

### TODOS: (future additions)

- [ ] Integration of indicators (sma, ema,...)
- [ ] convert trade functions to cloud functions housed on gcp (google cloud platform)
- [ ] integrate alpaca api as a brokerage for my algorithms to test in real world applications

### Contribute?

would love any help or suggestions on the application.

Feel free to open a PR.
