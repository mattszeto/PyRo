# PyRo

Python trading Robot that can track historical stock data or real-time stock data for algorithmic trading.
Its basically the foundation for a trading robot, with indicator functions to execute buys and sells at certain times.

Uses TD ameritrades API for collection historical/real-time stock data.

This has been my Quarantine project and It's definitely far from done.

Future additions to be made:
- Integration of indicators (sma, ema,...)
- convert trade functions to cloud functions housed on gcp (google cloud platform)
- integrate alpaca api as a brokerage for my algorithms to test in real world applications


Feel free to contribute.
